# **App Name**: AI Arena

## Core Features:

- Model Selection: Allow users to select from a list of AI models (GPT-5, Claude-4 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-1, Perplexity).
- Simultaneous Prompting: Provide a single input field for users to enter a prompt that is simultaneously sent to all selected AI models via Open Router.
- Response Comparison: Display the responses from all models side-by-side in a column layout, making it easy to compare outputs.
- Response Evaluation: Enable users to evaluate each response and "pick the best" response based on the individual models' output.
- Copy Response: Allow users to copy the complete AI response by clicking on the message.
- Quality Check: Leverage AI to analyze responses from different AI models using a tool. Use this tool for automated filtering of repetitive and redundant content, aiding users to focus solely on genuinely unique model outputs. Highlight key disparities among model responses based on comparative assessment by the AI. This allows users to pinpoint exactly how one response differs from another, focusing on variations in insight or solution approaches.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082), evocative of the depth of AI understanding.
- Background color: Light lavender (#E6E6FA), a muted variant of indigo to ensure comfortable readability.
- Accent color: Bright gold (#FFD700) to highlight the 'best' AI response, signaling triumph in comparative selection.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look; suitable for headlines or body text
- Use minimalist icons to represent different AI models and actions (copy, evaluate).
- Divide the screen into a responsive grid layout, with each column dedicated to a specific AI model's response.
- Use subtle animations to indicate when new responses are loading from the AI models.
